And it’s one with many answers – there are all kinds of reasons why the greatest films ever made endure in the way they do. They create unforgettable images, conjure overwhelming emotions, craft thrilling stories, and deliver characters who leap off the screen. There’s astonishing technical mastery that brings those stories to life, plots that twist and turn in all kinds of unexpected ways, performances that help us fall head-over-heels for people who don’t exist, and transcendent experiences that change our heads and hearts. The best films – from classic movies that have stood the test of time, to contemporary works that changed the game – offer heartwarming comfort, iconic scares, big laughs, and pulse-pounding suspense, becoming firm audience favourites and garnering critical acclaim.",

It might not have been the first to tap this particular trope, but it's head and shoulders above the rest. Murray's snarktastic delivery makes the early going easy to laugh at, but as the movie finds deeper things to say about existence and morals, it never feels like a polemic.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Groundhog Day](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/groundhog-day-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

Yet co-writer/director [Paul King](https://www.empireonline.com/people/paul-king/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer} delivered a truly wonderful film bursting with joy, imagination, kindness and just one or two hard stares. How was he going to follow that? Turns out, with more of the same, but also plenty of fresh pleasures. Paddington (bouncily voiced by [Ben Whishaw](https://www.empireonline.com/people/ben-whishaw/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}) matches wits with washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan ([Hugh Grant](https://www.empireonline.com/people/hugh-grant/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}, chewing scenery like fine steak), being framed for theft and getting sent to prison. Like all great sequels, it works superbly as a double bill with the original.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Paddington 2](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/paddington-2-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

It'll break your heart and offer hope all at the same time, and the film ended up scoring Best Adapted Screenplay, Music and Directing Oscars.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Brokeback Mountain](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/brokeback-mountain-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

Leung plays a journalist renting an apartment in 1960s Hong Kong; his neighbour, played by Maggie Cheung, appears as lonely and lost as he is. It soon emerges their spouses are having an affair, and a romance of stolen glances and intimate longing begins to emerge. Love stories are rarely as ravishingly beautiful (or deeply influential) as this.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of In The Mood For Love](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/mood-love-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

As it turns out, one of the most innovative, refreshing, unbearably tense horror movies of the 21st century. From the second it starts, the imposed silence of _A Quiet Place_ makes it a revelatory cinematic experience – as the Abbott family pad gently around their home, the store, the woods, you feel in your bones that one wrong step equals disaster. The (loudly) ticking time bomb of imminent childbirth sets the scene for a stellar scary finale, but it's the deeply endearing family dynamic that sets this apart.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of A Quiet Place](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/quiet-place-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

A blockbuster of behemothic proportions. The weight of expectations on _Endgame_ — the culmination of 11 years of interweaving stories, following up the greatest cinematic cliffhanger since _The Empire Strikes Back_ — was immense, which only makes it more miraculous that the Russo Brothers (and writers [Christopher Markus](https://www.empireonline.com/people/christopher-markus/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer} \u0026 Stephen McFeeley) delivered a thrilling, adventurous, emotional time-travelling trip through the entire MCU so far. The character pay-offs are just as staggering as the action — and when Steve Rogers finally proved worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, a stone-cold cultural moment was created.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Avengers: Endgame](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/avengers-endgame-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

After ten years and eighteen movies, Marvel took superhero filmmaking to a new level when they united all of Earth's mightiest heroes (and several more) against The Mad Titan himself – and incredibly, devastatingly, they lost. _Infinity War_ crashed much-loved characters into each other's orbits, flitting between planets at breakneck speed as the Avengers desperately tried to stop Thanos from clicking his fingers and wiping out half the universe. Spectacular action, punch-the-air moments and big-scale battles are perfectly balanced, as all things should be, with hilarious interplays and aching emotion. Cinema doesn't get much bigger, or better, than this.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/avengers-infinity-war-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

It might have taken 20 years for [Peter Jackson](https://www.empireonline.com/people/peter-jackson/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}'s plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever._The Fellowship Of The Ring_ contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up. But Jackson is only getting started. Onwards his adventure hustles, to the bravura dungeoneering of Khazad-dum, to the sinisterly serene glades of Lothlorien, to the final requiem for flawed Boromir amidst autumnal leaves. As _Fellowship_ thrums to its conclusion, finally applying the brakes with a last swell of [Howard Shore](https://www.empireonline.com/people/howard-shore/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}'s heavenly score, you're left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time. _The Two Towers_ has the coolest battle. _The Return Of The King_ boasts the most batshit, operatic spectacle. But Fellowship remains the most perfect of the three, matching every genius action beat with a soul-stirring emotional one, as its Middle-earth-traversing gang swells in size in the first act, then dwindles in the third. This oddball suicide squad has so much warmth and wit, they're not just believable as friends of each other — they've come to feel like they're our pals too.An ornately detailed masterwork with a huge, pulsing heart, it's just the right film for our times — full of craft, conviction and a belief that trudging forward, step by step, in dark days is the bravest act of all. Its ultimate heroes aren't the strongest, or those with the best one-liners, but the ones who just keep going. And so _Fellowship_ endures: a miracle of storytelling, a feat of filmmaking and still the gold standard for cinematic experiences. Right, now that's decided, who's up for second breakfast?\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/lord-rings-fellowship-ring-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

And [Harold Ramis](https://www.empireonline.com/people/harold-ramis/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer} (directing and co-writing with Danny Rubin) managing to find gold in the story of a man trapped in a time loop. It might not have been the first to tap this particular trope, but it's head and shoulders above the rest. Murray's snarktastic delivery makes the early going easy to laugh at, but as the movie finds deeper things to say about existence and morals, it never feels like a polemic.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Groundhog Day](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/groundhog-day-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

Yet co-writer/director [Paul King](https://www.empireonline.com/people/paul-king/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer} delivered a truly wonderful film bursting with joy, imagination, kindness and just one or two hard stares. How was he going to follow that? Turns out, with more of the same, but also plenty of fresh pleasures. Paddington (bouncily voiced by [Ben Whishaw](https://www.empireonline.com/people/ben-whishaw/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}) matches wits with washed-up actor Phoenix Buchanan ([Hugh Grant](https://www.empireonline.com/people/hugh-grant/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}, chewing scenery like fine steak), being framed for theft and getting sent to prison. Like all great sequels, it works superbly as a double bill with the original.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Paddington 2](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/paddington-2-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

Yet while the majority of the film is more of a straight-ahead adventure tale (albeit one with a wacky bird and talking dogs), that doesn't make it any less satisfying. And let's be honest — the story of a man who uses balloons to float his house to a foreign land, accidentally picking up a young wilderness explorer scout as he does, feels perfectly Pixar.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of Up](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/movie-2-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

And it all started with this, the Oscar-winning kick-off to his film career in which [Daniel Kaluuya](https://www.empireonline.com/people/daniel-kaluuya/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}'s Chris meets his girlfriend Rose's ([Allison Williams](https://www.empireonline.com/people/allison-williams/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}) parents and discovers some truly shocking secrets. White guilt, specific racism, slavery and more blend into a socially conscious terror tale that rings every note with pitch-perfect accuracy.

It is arguably his greatest gift to cinema, an infinitely ambitious vision of a space-faring future whose narrative centres on the most pivotal moment in human evolution since some ape-man first bashed another ape-man with an old bone. Graceful, gorgeous, unwearied by time's passing. Rather like that monolith.\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of 2001: A Space Odyssey](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/2001-space-odyssey-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

Spectacular action, punch-the-air moments and big-scale battles are perfectly balanced, as all things should be, with hilarious interplays and aching emotion.

It might have taken 20 years for [Peter Jackson](https://www.empireonline.com/people/peter-jackson/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}'s plucky fantasy to clamber, Mount-Doom-style, to the very pinnacle of our greatest-movies pantheon. But here it is, brighter and more resplendent than ever._The Fellowship Of The Ring_ contains so much movie. Even at the halfway point, as the characters take a breather to bicker in Rivendell, you already feel sated, like you've experienced more thrills, more suspense, more jollity and ethereal beauty than a regular film could possibly muster up. But Jackson is only getting started. Onwards his adventure hustles, to the bravura dungeoneering of Khazad-dum, to the sinisterly serene glades of Lothlorien, to the final requiem for flawed Boromir amidst autumnal leaves. As _Fellowship_ thrums to its conclusion, finally applying the brakes with a last swell of [Howard Shore](https://www.empireonline.com/people/howard-shore/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}'s heavenly score, you're left feeling euphoric, bereft and hopeful, all at the same time. _The Two Towers_ has the coolest battle. _The Return Of The King_ boasts the most batshit, operatic spectacle. But Fellowship remains the most perfect of the three, matching every genius action beat with a soul-stirring emotional one, as its Middle-earth-traversing gang swells in size in the first act, then dwindles in the third. This oddball suicide squad has so much warmth and wit, they're not just believable as friends of each other — they've come to feel like they're our pals too.An ornately detailed masterwork with a huge, pulsing heart, it's just the right film for our times — full of craft, conviction and a belief that trudging forward, step by step, in dark days is the bravest act of all. Its ultimate heroes aren't the strongest, or those with the best one-liners, but the ones who just keep going. And so _Fellowship_ endures: a miracle of storytelling, a feat of filmmaking and still the gold standard for cinematic experiences. Right, now that's decided, who's up for second breakfast?\n\n  \n\n[Read Empire's review of The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/lord-rings-fellowship-ring-review/){:target=_blank :rel=noopener noreferrer}",

The best films – from classic movies that have stood the test of time, to contemporary works that changed the game – offer heartwarming comfort, iconic scares, big laughs, and pulse-pounding suspense, becoming firm audience favourites and garnering critical acclaim.",
